When you are about to start on a User Interface design, the first thing you should do is do a research on your target audience, ask yourself, "Who am I designing for?", and "What tasks are the users going to be using this User Interface for?" look for great similar solutions on the web and draw inspirations from them. This will not only save you a lot of time with your design, it will also challenge your level of creativity and give you ideas on how to go about your design.

	<li>Come up with sketches or low fidelity wireframes that gives the best representation for the requirements you are designing for.</li>
	<li>Share your low fidelity wireframes with the stakeholders, keep iterating your low fidelity wireframes till it satisfies the requirements presentation.</li>
	<li>Come up with a prototype and test with a few users, reiterate your prototype using the feedback you receive.</li>
